My own repos fall roughly into these categories:
- 🔧 CPU Design
  - https://github.com/nczempin/NICNAC16-FPGA (Verilog)
- 💻 Operating Systems Development
  - https://github.com/nczempin/naxos (C)
- 📚 Programming Language Learning
  - https://github.com/nczempin/go-learn (Go)
- ⚙️ (Linux) Systems Programming
  - https://github.com/nczempin/linuxsysprog (C)
- 🔍 Git Internals
  - https://github.com/nczempin/mygit (C++)
- 🤖 Machine Learning
  - https://github.com/nczempin/gym-tic-tac-toe (Python)
  - https://github.com/nczempin/gym-nim (Python)
- ♟️ Chess Engines
  - https://github.com/nczempin/arcadia-chess-engine (C++)
  - https://github.com/nczempin/zathras (C++)
  - https://github.com/nczempin/eden-chess-engine (Java)
- 🎮 Game Development
  - https://github.com/nczempin/antisuns-public-dev-docs/wiki just the link to a sign-up form for now; infos and pictures will be next. I am actually working on a commercial PC game now. It's called "Antisuns". That link is my current, early page where I collect the dev info that I can share publicly.
  - https://github.com/nczempin/fluxagama (Python) was meant as an exercise for my sons when they were learning to code. One of them's a video game developer now, but probably not because of this :-D
  - 🏃 Game Jams
    - https://github.com/nczempin/lizard-journey (Lua)
    - https://github.com/nczempin/Turres-Monacorum (Lua)
    - https://github.com/nczempin/Turn-the-Corner (C#)

I'd say 99 % are experiments/exercises for me to learn / try things.

That said, they could still benefit from a bit more description etc. (TODO)

A repo I briefly "saved" (the original developer came back):
- 🗣️ Natural Language Learning
  - https://github.com/nczempin/fltr
